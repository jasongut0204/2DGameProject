# This is my journey towards creating my first ever video game. Ill try to keep updating the repository as much as I can. Currently this is a passion project I am pursuing while studying for computer engineering. The end goal is to create a metroidvania style game with unique mechanics and souls like gameplay. While also having a rich narrative.
